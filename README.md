# times-of-victory-vic3-mod
 Times of Victory is a mod that aims to represent the world during the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648, an event that ended the wars of religion and changed diplomacy in Europe. In this period, modern nation-states were already very well consolidated and the Americas had not yet been fully colonized.
