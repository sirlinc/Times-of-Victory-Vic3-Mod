Many individuals wish to be part of railways through Africa; dams across the Nile; fleets of ocean Greyhounds; majestic, self-amortizing canals; plantations of ripening tea; all from tuppence prudently, fruitfully, frugally invested (to be specific) in the Dawes-Tomes-Mousely-Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank."
 # silver_standard_desc: "This meant a currency system based on silver. Money was cheaper to produce by the government which meant that there was rarely any lack of money in the country. However, the problem was that the silver prices had a tendency to be dominated by gold prices, which meant that foreign trade was often suffering."
#  acidic_and_basic_converters: "Acidic and Basic Converters"
#  acidic_and_basic_converters_desc: "The original Bessemer converters had a lining of insulating clay between the walls and the molten iron. The #clay is acidic and affects the composition of the resulting steel. By replacing the clay with basic (alkaline) materials such as magnesite, chromite or dolomite, or more acidic materials such as ganister, the process can be fine tuned to remove even more impurities, depending upon the content of the iron ore."
#  fluid_compressed_steel: "Fluid Compressed Steel"
#  fluid_compressed_steel_desc: "This process involves the use of a hydraulic forging press to put the steel under great pressure while still a #fluid. This squeezes the tiny pockets of gas impurities out of the cooling ingots, allowing for a much higher quality steel by preventing the #formation of blowholes and piping."

#  self_acting_looms_desc: "Gradual improvements in loom technology have transformed the weaving industry and vastly increased the output of fabrics #factories. By using mechanical power for more and more operations, the role of the weaver is reduced to merely keeping the machine running and #clearing blockages. Children are especially useful for this as they can crawl into smaller spaces than adults. Shutting the machines down while #such work is carried out has been judged to be less profitable than allowing for the occasional child to be mangled."
#  smithian_economics: "Smithian Economics"

#  tunnelling_shields_desc: "When digging a mine shaft or railway tunnel, supporting the vast weight of the earth above the workers is vital for the #integrity of the project. A tunnelling shield is a mobile structure made of steel that provides temporary support on the active site of digging. #As the tunnelling shield is moved along, such as on a railway track, a more permanent support is laid, such as brickwork or timbers. The first #use of such a device was in the construction of the Thames Tunnel in 1825 by Anglo-French engineer Marc Isambard Brunel, the father of the more #famous Isambard Kingdom Brunel."
# alienation: "Alienation"

# religion_of_humanity: "Religion of Humanity"
# religion_of_humanity_desc: "The rise of secularism has started to free our people from the chains of superstition that religion forces on people but at the same time we lost the societal cohesion that organized religion provided.
